## Upload your color images

For the color options you have, you can either let the smartness of the script provide a color for you, or you can upload an image that represents that color.


_ The way I have gotten my images from my products in my demo shop was to open up each product image on my storefront in the “colorbox” (lightbox) and grab around ~ 40 by 40 pixels section of the product image, then save that small screen grab to my desktop, and rename the image.

> There's an important naming convention to respect here! The image must be named after the color option, but be handleized, and have a .png extension.

For example, if you have a color called 'Déjà Vu Blue', then name your image deja-vu-blue.png

Other example, if your color is 'Blue/Gray', then name your image blue-gray.png.

1. Most simple example, if your color is 'Black', the name your image black.png.

2. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Themes.**

3. Find the theme you want to edit, and then click **Actions > Edit code.**

4. On the **Edit HTML/CSS page**, locate and click on the **Assets** folder to reveal its content.

5. Under the **Assets** heading, click on the **Add** a new asset link.

6. **Upload your image.**

Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have uploaded all your images.
