In Shopify, you can edit your site via **Sections **and **Theme settings**
(_New to Shopify? Please refer to [this](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings) to get knowledge of what **Sections **and **Theme settings** are_)

{% sample lang="Sections" %}

Sections let you empower merchants by giving them greater flexibility when customizing their online store ([source](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/introducing-sections-for-shopify-themes)). 
There are two types of Sections: Static and Dynamic .

**1. Static sections:** 
        
Static sections are sections which will be added statically to a specific part or page of the theme. Static sections basically have all the functions like dynamic ones, except they can not be moved.
        
If a section is separated from others via top and bottom spaces, it is static.
