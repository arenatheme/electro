When you install our app [Arena Installation](https://install.arenathemes.com/admin/install), most of the Sections and  General Settings as well as the Products and other components will be included to your site, you just need to adjust the settings to be the same as the sample demo store. Clicking on any of these "section" blocks will bring up a set of unique configuration settings, or you can click "Add Section", which will reveal an array of other optional sections that you can add to your homepage. We'll cover each of them in detail - more or less in the order they appear below.

### **Fixed Homepage Block**

Fixed blocks are exactly what you’d guess they are—components that are fixed to certain areas of your site and cannot be moved. In our theme, there are four fixed homepage blocks: **Top Bar, Header, Instagram - Newsletter Block, Footer.**

**To Config Topbar, Header & Footer please go to Themes -&gt; Customize Theme -&gt; Theme Settings**

#### **Header**
    
Header appears on every page and is intended to be used to promote your company's brand and make it instantly recognizable to your visitors. This is a static block and cannot be repositioned. **We support 4 styles of header.**

    1.Header Style #1:

    4.Header Style #4:

Header style #4 is special because it has its own slideshow attached to it, so when you choose header style #4, you won't be able to use Section Slideshow.

#### **Footer**

Like a footer on a document or report, a website footer contains the information listed at the bottom of a page. Typically, the footer is the area that visitors expect to find the "fine print"—legal information such as **terms and conditions** and **privacy policies**, but also **FAQs**, and **contact information**. Our theme provides 3 footer styles.

1.Footer Style #1
