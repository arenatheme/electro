* [Duplicate your theme](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes)
  to create a backup copy. This makes it easy to discard your changes and start again if you need to.

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store &gt; Themes**
2. Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**

Different types of pages have different theme sections. When you first open the theme editor, the settings for the home page are shown. To access the settings for other pages, **select the page type from the top bar drop-down menu:**![](/assets/settings.png)

The theme editor toolbar is divided into **Sections **and T**heme settings**.  
Next, let's explore how to configure our theme with built-in **Sections** and **Theme settings**
