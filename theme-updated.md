### Add an updated version of your theme to your online store

When you manually add an updated version of a theme, a second version of the theme is added to your online store. The new version is in its default state, with none of your customizations applied. The older version is unaffected by the update, and still has all of your code customizations.

[1. Create a backup copy of your existing theme.](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes)
2. Download the new theme file from ThemeForest or install our Arena Installation App.
3. [Install the new version ](/README.md)as new theme for your store.
